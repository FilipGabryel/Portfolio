# About me
My name is Filip Gabryel. I am interested in software testing with strong desire to learn and develop. Ocasionally doing projects for utest.com. I'm looking for a job as Software Tester that will allow me to spread wings in this industry.

I would like to share here my skills and experience in tools gained from personal study and reaserches.
